# Stock Market

## General overview of the project
The project that my team and I present is about Stock Market Analysis using Yahoo Finance and the code obtained from the Towards Data Science webpage in order to scrape the information containing the stock data (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume, Name), the topic that will be covered is to create a portfolio in order to suggest people or companies to invest. By working on the data, the target is to create a model that helps predict possible ups and downs in the market using the historical stock prices. The main reason to select this topic is that this data is real and will be of great use to polish skills and make something that will be useful for someone that wants to invert in the stock market, with this in mind we could have the chance to create a company that allows us to advise people or even companies about how to invest their money in the market with potential good results or even take a better decisions in our own investments.
Using a time series model and machine learning models, specially Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks, the data will be tested and trained to try to accomplish a good percent of accuracy. For this, the data that will be used are samples taken in regular time intervals, with pandas, numpy and matplotlib, the time behavior can be observed. Also, it is important to note that Keras will be used and, a deeper research on exponential smoothing will be made.

## Self-Assessment

Through all phases of this project we had different roles, I don't think that no one in the team had a unique roll because we all colaborate together to complete this project, but if I have to assign me a roll I would say that I had a X roll in the project because I propouse the view of the dashboard in the project.
According with the last the contribution that I had in my roll was to colaborated with my team to apply the models to our data, make the result analysis with all the members of the team and also make the Dashboard to visualize in a easy way the obtenined results.


The biggest challenge making this project was to coordinate the team and working together to obtein a good analysis and also put our ideas together to get a final result of this project, we also need to make some meetings in addition to those considered in the bootcam schedule in which we showw to other members of the team the progress of the project, this made more agile the team work as we have a good communication and in consequence we have a better result.



## Team Assessment

The communication protocols are the followings, in which we had 3 or 4 meetings per week and also we are regular communicated in Slack and also Whatsapp:
- Slack
- Whatsapp
- Zoom Bootcamp
-Zoom o Meets

I think that one of our biggest strengths as a team is that we always have a good communication all the time and that we always consider the opinion of each member of the team in every step we made into this project, with this we can take desicions together and combine our ideas to add value to the project.
One trick that I would want share is always have a good communication with your team and aways consider all the opinios to have different perspectives of the this, this allows a better analysis and a better coercion on the team.


## Summary of Project 

The project is about Stock Market Analysis using Yahoo Finance and the code obtained from the Towards Data Science webpage in order to scrape the information containing the stock data and with this create a portfolio in order to suggest people or companies to invest.
For the data we use different models to test the accuracy for example SVM, ANN and other models will be used to train and test the data, also libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib, etc. The challenge is to get the best accuracy possible for the models and to make a good use of the code to get the expected results to make an accurate portfolio of the suggested investments.
In the results we can se that the Long short-term memory (LSTM) have a better aproache to fit the original data, this means that the data follow the same tendency compared to the original data, in the other hand we can see fot in the ARIMA that the aproache for the predicted data in some stocks are better that others, but we need to consider that this happend when we compare one stock vs all the stocks that we are considering for this analysis, and we only took one year of data, we need to implement this model with more data amount.
